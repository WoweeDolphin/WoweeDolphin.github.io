This term we did fuze boxes and our blogs. Fuze boxes are android devices that you plug in through the hdmi cable. The fuze both at WE got had a booklet, full of instructions on coding WE could do in an application, named fuze basic. We worked in pairs, my pair was Sean (the-it-bite.github.io). We started at the first stage. It was to create a program that asked the person how old they are. Then we set up three variables, showing a different message depending on the ageâ€¦.

After this, we used the lights and connected them to the breadboard. This let us create a sequence when different lights light up at different times. This required very hard code.

Finally, we got a robot arm, and did a program that could move the arm by typing numbers in. We could articulate every part of it.

All our code is on a memory stick.
