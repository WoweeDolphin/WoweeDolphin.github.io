This was our first lesson back after half term. Mr keen called us to the front and asked us if we could program a robot to be able to make a cup of tea. It turned out that it was much harder than we thought it would be! It involved using lots of different steps and ended up being very complex! We ended up discussing how a robot arm moves.
