Our new topic this term is to use codecademy to learn python, a programming language which is use widely. Codecademy is a widely used way to learn your programming languages. We quickly got started and delved right into python once we logged in with our google id and started. It started out extremely easy but over time, got harder and required much more thought. Mr Keen told us that our final subject is going to create a game of battleships. He also told us that our homework was thirty minutes on our blogs and on codecademy.
